1)what is Angular?
ans)
A javascript framework for building client side applications using HMTL,CSS and javascript.

2)why angular?
ans)
a) expressive html (if,for loop in HTML using ng tags)
b) powerful data binding
c) modular design
4) built in back end calling support

3)why angular. we had angular js right?
ans)
a) built for speed
b) simplified API, less directives
c) faster development.

4)what is angular application?
angular application = list of components with services.
component = template + class(properties + methods) + metadata

5) what language can be used to write angular application?
ans)
a) JS ES 6
b) Typescript


6)what is typescript?
ans)
a) open source langugae
b) superset of java
c) converts to JS in browser
d) stringly typed.
e) Object oriented.

7)what are different editors we can use for Angular coding.
ans)
a) Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
b) Atom
c) eclipse
d) Sublime

8) what are software required to do angular ?
ans)
a) nodejs (npm) - package manager to install all libraries
b) angular CLI - for automated creation of components and start server etc..

9)what is package.json?
ans)
it lists all packages required for angular which will be installed by npm.
you can go to this folder in command prompt and give "npm install". it will
install all software inside this.

10)how to start server and kill server?
ans)

start server: ng serve -o
kill server: ctrl-c or commnd-c

11)what are angular  modules ? 
ans)
this is used to organize files. a class is module. u can import as follows.

export class Product{
}

import {Product} from './product'

12)what is component

template --> view created with HTML + includes binding and directives
Class --> properties and method, created with Typescript and Logic
Metadata --> Extra data for angular defined with a decorator.

13) create a simple component class?
ans)

export class Product{      //export makes others can use.
	pageTitle: string = 'Anand';
}

class can have constructor and methods and variables.

14) what is metadata decorator?
ans)
it is something like annotation we use in java spring. Like
@RestController tell spring the class is controller. in similar way
below annotation tells below class is component.

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})


15) what is HTML template.?
ans) its html code.

16)how do you import an class? 
ans)you can import youe own class or the classes defined by angular.

import {Product} from './product'
	or to import @Component decorator use,
import {Component} from '@angular/core'

17)what is data binding.
ans)

lets say you have TS file,

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})
export class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {
	userName: string = null;
  constructor() { 
	this.userName =sessionStorage.getItem('username');
  }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}

and You have html page

{{userName}}

this is called data binding. we are getting userName from TS file.
angular make sure the value is avilable in html page.

18)is angular SPA?
ans) yes. SPA means single page application. we have just one HTML and all calls wont reload the page.
its just brings the html page and show in main page.

19)what is a directive?
ans)
we cna think it has a custom html code added by Angular. or we can define our own angular directive.
it is used to extend directive.

20)what is the shortcut to open developer tools for debugging?
ans)
F12

21) how to debug typescript code?
ans)
a) open developer tool - F12
b) open source tab
c) under webpack u can see type script
d) opne the file put breakpoint and then you can test the code.

22) what is difference between inline template and linked template?
ans) In Metadata decorator we can give inline HTML using "template:" or we can give external
template file using "templateUrl" whihc is called linked template.

23)how to use component as a directive?
ans) we can use 'selector' in metadata decorator. if any body want to use below template, they can use selector "<app-header></app-header>"

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})
export class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {
  userName: string = null;
  constructor() { 
  this.userName =sessionStorage.getItem('username');
  }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}

24)what is data binding?
ans) passing data between template and the component's class is called data binding.

25)what is interpolation?
ans) its one way binding from compnent class into component template.
code inside double curly braces is called interpolation or template expression. we can do calculation, appending inside interpolation.
you can also called method from interpolation.

class:

export class Product{      //export makes others can use.
  pageTitle: string = 'Anand';
}


Template:
{{pageTitle}}


TODO for chetu
a) use mathmatical expression inside interpolcation
b) use some variable value from interpolation
c) use some mehtod output from interpolation.

26) what are structural directive?
ans)
its angular built in directive. 

example:
a) *ngIf
b) *ngFor

* means structural directive which changes/manipulates the element of the tag for which we put that.

example:
<div *ngIf='products && products.length'>
//some code
</div>

only if there is data then only code inside div is shown.

<div *ngFor='let product of products'>
{{product.name}}
{{product.price}}
</div>


TODO Chetu:
define some hardcoded list in class and use it in template to loop and hwo 
the data
also define something in class and use if condition to show it or not in template.


27)how did you get ngIf and ngFor directives?
ans) its defined inbuilt by angular in BrowserModule which wil be imported
in angular module.

28) what is property binding?
ans) populating HTML element property value from component class is called prperty binding.
this is also one way binding.

<img [src]='product.imageUrl' [title]='product.name' [style.width.px]='imageWidth' [style.margin.px]='iamgeMargin'>

here 'product.imageUrl' is template expression whose value is defined in component class.
note that propery name has to be enclosed in in []

29)what is event binding?
ans)
<button (click)='toggleImage()'>
note that event name "click" has to be enclosed in (). here toggleImage() method has to 
be defined in component class.

TODO chetu:
show image and hide image using button  "click"  event and  "*ngIf" directive.

30)what is two way binding?
ans)

suppose if we have texbox, we want its value to be shown from compoennet class and alos
if it values is updated in browser by user, i thas to be updated back. this is called
2 way data binding.


In template:
<input [(ngModel)]='listFilter'>

In Component class:
export class ListComponent{
  listFilter: string = 'cart';
}

31)which module "ngModel" directive is in?
asn) Formmodule and you need to import it in your component class or
module file to use that.

32)what are some built-in pipes and why it is used? give example. Also what is pipe chaining?
ans)Pipes are used for data formatting. below are common pipes and there are many other. check in google.
date
number
decimal
percent
currency
json
slice
lowercase
uppercase

Example:
In interpplation:  {{product.productCode |  lowercase}}
In property binding: <img [src]='product.url' [title]='product.name | uppercase' />

Example for pipe chaining:
{{product.price |  currency | lowercase }}

33) what are pipe parameters?
ans) some pipe we can specify parameters 
example:

{{product.price |  currency:'USD':'symbol':'1.2-2' }}

TODO CHetu:
use piping in one of our project and test it.

34)if there is some data for which we dont have type, like custom type. how u define a type?
ans)
we have to use interface.

export interface IProduct{
productId: number;
name: string;
releaseDate: Date  
}
}

then you can import it and use it.

35) explain component lifcycle hooks?
ans)
OnInit:perform component initalization like bringing some backend data

onChanges: perform action after change to input properties.

onDestroy: perform any clean up

you need to import the methods.

import {Component, onInit} from '@angular/core';

export class ProductsComponent implements OnInit {

ngOnInit() {

}


36)how to create a custom pipe?
ans)
a) 

import {Pipe,PipeTransform} from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name:'convertToSpaces'
})
export class ConvertToSpacesPipe implements PipeTransform{
transform(value:string,character:string) : string{
    return value.replace(character,' ');
  }
}

b) TO use it:
{{prodcut.name | convertToSpaces:'-'}}
}
}

c) add the declration to app-module 

37)how to filter a list in angular template page?
ans)
a) create a texbox in UI for filtering products.
b) for that texbox value have a variable in compenent class. have getter and setter. (Basically you select the line with the property, then a Quick Action bulb is shown which you have to click. Then you can generate the getters/setters.)
c) in setter method make sure u filter the copy of product list along with setter value

38)when to nest the component?
ans) if the nested component is only small part of the parent component.
example: star component(rating) in products list component

39)how to use nested component?
ans) we need to use selector used on metadata decorator of nested component
as tag in parent component. the child component as to be defined in modules.


<app-header></app-header> in app.component.html

40) how to pass data to a nested component?
ans)

In nest component define @Input().

example: in class
@Input() rating:number;

example: in html, pass rating as attribute.

<pm-star [rating]='234234'>
</pm-star>


41)how to pass data from nested component back to parent component?
ans)

//declare eventemitter for the variable data which we need to pass. here notify is event name.
@Output() notify:EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();   // note the generic syntax where we can pass ant object/data to parent component.

//then whatever value you want to emit, use below code.
this.notify.emit('anand narappa')

//if you want to trigger the event onClick in child compoenent html page, havea method onClick in your child class compoenent.
onClick(){
  this.notify.emit('clicked');
}

in parent html page:

<pm-star (notify) = 'onchildButtonclicked($event)'>
</pm-star>


so when you click, onclick method is called which creates the event, since notify event was called onNotify will triggered, which will call onNotify(), which can
be defined in parent compoenent and use it values.

onchildButtonclicked(message:string):void {}

42)how to build a service?
ans)

ng g service <servicename>

43)how to inject a service into component class?
ans)
add to constructor as shown below.

private userservice1: UserService,

44) what is observable and reactive extensions? (RXJS)
ans)

a) Help manage asynchronous data
b) subscribe to receive notifications.


45)how to declare Observable object?
ans)

const source$: Observable<number> = range(0,10);

46)wht is Observable?
ans) Its like JS promise. used to get values.


47) difference between Promise and Observable?
ans)

Promise
a) Provides a single future value
b) not lazy
c) Not cancellable

Observable
a)EMits mutiple values at time
b) Lazy
c) Cancellable
d)suppirts map,filter,reduce and similar operators


48) how to make http request to server?
ans)

a) import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http'

b) inject in constructor
constructor(){private http:HttpClient}

c) make sure HttpClientModule is added in imports in app.modules.ts

d) make  a call
this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/getProducts')
it returns Observable object back for which we need to sunscribe and get the value.

OR we can also define type for eturn type which returns Observable<IProduct>
this.http.get<IProduct[]>('http://localhost:8080/getProducts')


49) how to get value from subscribe?
ans)

  getAllProducts(){
    console.log("chetu inside ProductsComponent")
    this.productService.getAllProducts().
    subscribe(res => {
                          this.productsList = res;
                     }
              );
  }

  50) what is safe navigation operator?
  ans) when accessing product.productName, if product is null or undefined, we get error. we can use
  product?.productName which will do null check. ? is called safe navigation operator.


  51)how to configure router.
  a)import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';  in app.module.ts
  b)add AppRoutingModule into "imports"
  c) in app-routing.module.ts add Routes

  const routes: Routes = [
  {
  path: '', 
  component: HomepageComponent
  },
   {
  path: 'productdetail/:id', 
  component: ProductdetailComponent
  }
];


52)how to define default route?
ans)
{path '', redirectTo:'welcome',pathMatch:'full'}

53)how to define pagenotfoundcomponent. if they give unknown path?
ans)
 {
  path: '**', 
  component: PageNotFoundComponent
  }


54)how to link routes to user actions like link?
ans)

<a [routerLink="['/products']"]>product list</a></li>

55)how to pass parameter to routes?

In config:
 {
  path: 'productdetail/:id', 
  component: ProductdetailComponent
  }

In html:
<td><a [routerLink]="['/productdetail',product.id]" class="btn btn-primary">Buy Product</a></td>

In component class:


  constructor(activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute,private productService: ProductService) { 
      console.log("anand...");
    console.log(activatedRoute.snapshot.paramMap.get("id"));
    this.selectedProductId = activatedRoute.snapshot.paramMap.get("id");
    this.getProduct();
  }

  import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router'

56)how to invoke a route in component class rather than html code?
ans)
his.router.navigate(['/products']);

57)how to add Guards to Routes as we want to add some restrictions?
ans)

CanActivate interface.   based on certain conditions.
CanDeactivate
Resolve
CanLoad

c)exports array
d)imports array
e)providers array


59) tell some import commands in ANgualre CLI

ans)

ng new --  for creating new applications
